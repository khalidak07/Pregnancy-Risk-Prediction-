# Pregnancy-Risk-Prediction-

Overview
This project aims to address the challenge of high-risk pregnancies in developing nations, particularly Nigeria. It focuses on women from lower and middle-income backgrounds who often lack access to proper healthcare and awareness about potential pregnancy complications.

Objective
The main goal is to develop a machine learning classification model and a web application to predict the risk level of pregnancy complications. The model classifies patients into low, medium, or high-risk categories based on various health factors during pregnancy.

Features
Utilizes an AdaBoost machine learning model for predictions
Web application built with Streamlit for easy user interaction
Predicts pregnancy risk levels based on key health indicators
Dataset
The model is trained on an open-source dataset from Kaggle, which includes the following features:

Age
Body Temperature
Heart Rate
Systolic Blood Pressure
Diastolic Blood Pressure
BMI
Blood Glucose (HbA1c)
Blood Glucose (Fasting)
Dataset source: Pregnancy Risk Factor Data on Kaggle

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for machine learning
Streamlit for web application deployment
Recommendations
This project introduces an innovative approach to analyze and predict the severity of risk factors in maternal and fetal health. By leveraging Data Science and Machine Learning, it offers a data-driven perspective on pregnancy risk assessment. However, it's important to emphasize that while this tool provides valuable insights, it should complement rather than replace expert clinical judgment, which remains crucial for individual patient care.

The model's predictive capabilities demonstrate the potential of ML in supporting healthcare decisions. Nevertheless, there's room for further enhancement. Future research could focus on expanding the dataset to encompass a broader range of demographic and clinical variables. Additionally, exploring advanced techniques such as deep learning-based neural networks could uncover more complex patterns in the data, potentially leading to even more nuanced risk predictions.
